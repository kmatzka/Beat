/*
 
 The world is burning
 I'm on a train
 escaping the wasteland of reality
   and traveling home
 
 I still remember it:
 his strong hands carrying me
 keeping me safe from every danger in world
   except him
     himself
 
 this time it was me
 my arms around him
 helping him walk the short road to a house
 glowing warmly in the dark
 
 after trying to hit his sisters with plates
   after grabbing a knife
      "this is the end of me then"
         screaming and shouting
 we drove 100 kilometers maybe less maybe more
 to a place where they help
 people just like him
   maybe like me
 
 From dead to me
 to suddenly arisen
 but I'm not sure if he's truly risen
 if he'll ever give up
   the death inside him
     the death that's been slowly taking him away
        killing him in plain sight
 
 I can't help you
 I can't even help myself
 this is the furthest my now strong arms can take you
 you got me so far in life
   I know
 but here I draw the line
 on this door
 on these steps
 
 see you on the other side
 one way
 or another
